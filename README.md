# VBA-challenge
Week 2 Challenge

I have included a .vb showing the full VBA script, fully commented.

I have included the smaller altphabetical_testing.xlsm that was provided, which also has the full VBA script, and can run.

I have included three separate screenshots of the three sheets of the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.
Each screenshot demonstrates that the code effectively analyzed, summarized, formatted each sheet, and that it cycled through all three sheets.
